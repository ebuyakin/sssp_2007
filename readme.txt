The model description.

The model is designed as part of the research project on automatic and controlled sentence production.
The purpose of the model is to emulate certain aspects of the human sentence production, primarily variation
of linguistic form (lexical and syntactic choices made by the speaker) depending on speaker preferences/capabilities
w.r.t. complexity, accuracy, and fluency of the language.

The repository contains the following files:

1. model_01.py - code of the model that generates sentences in pseudo-language.
2. language_01.py - language generator, a class that produces pseudo language that is used by the model.
3. experiment_01.py - code of the simulations that used the model to collect statistical data on language production.
4. data_analysis_01.py - functions used to process and analyze collected statistical data.
5. sssp_2007_diagram.png - map of the model functions and their interactions.

6. utils.py - some helper functions
7. work.py - scratchpad used to test some ideas for the project.

8. xer_02.csv - data collected from the simulations
9. xer_03.csv - data collected from the simulations
